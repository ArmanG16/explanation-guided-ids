1. Create a script to clean out the processed data on the start of every run of preprocessing

2. Create functions for each stage
    - Preprocessing data
    - Mining CARs
    - Finding rules from CARs
    - Generating learning curve

3. It takes to long and too much RAM to mine the CARs, we need to find a way to run it faster
